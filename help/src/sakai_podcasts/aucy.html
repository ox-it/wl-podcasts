<h2>Podcasts: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Podcasts tool allows site leaders to create, store, and
distribute multimedia content to site participants via an
RSS feed. Content can take many different forms, including
audio lectures, video presentations, and slideshow presentations.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Subscription:</strong> Site participants can download
podcasts individually or subscribe to an RSS feed, which allows
podcasts to be downloaded automatically to a podcatcher.</p>

<p><strong>File Types:</strong> Several different file types are
supported within a podcast, including <code>.mp3</code>,
<code>.mp4</code>, and <code>.ppt</code>.</p>


<p><strong>Adding the Podcasts tool:</strong> You can add the Podcasts
tool to your site using Site
Setup. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardx">Adding, editing, or removing tools on the menubar using Site Setup</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>You can download and view podcasts on most computers with
podcatcher software. You do not need to own an iPod to view podcasts.

<br><br>
</li><li>For Indiana University students, faculty, and staff, podcatcher
software is available free of charge and available for download via
IUware Online.
